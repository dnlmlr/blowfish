# Blowfish Cipher
> This is a reasearch implementation of the [Blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)) block cipher. The only goal of this project is to get a better understanding of the algorithm and possibly check out optimizations. 

**This should NOT BE USED FOR REAL PROJECTS!**

For a much more professional and trustworthy implementation of Blowfish and many other algorithms, check out the [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto) project and in particular the [block-ciphers](https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers) repository.
